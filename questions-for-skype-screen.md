# Questions for tech Skype screen

My questions could be thought of as exploring the "state of the state" as PNNL.



1. [ ] Do you do agile?

1. [ ] Server mix? Linux & Windows?

1. [ ] Cloud compute? AWS? Azure? Mixed environment with VMWare?

1. [ ] What do you use for version control?
 * If more than one tool, say Git and SVN, how has that worked out?

[x] 1. If you have a sense for it, how would people react to someone forking their repo and contributing changes?

1. [ ] Do you use an artifact repository?

1. [ ] How variable are the development practices on different teams?
 * [ ] The motivation for the question is around gauging the level of effort (assuming the developers are open to change) to evolve to some consistency around tooling and branching and merging strategies, for example.

1. [ ] Do you create and use VM images (VMDKs, AMIs, etc.)? If so, what are your experiences with "baking in" software, if you're doing that? If you're not doing that, are you using automation to provision new servers?

1. [ ] Reading thru the DOE contract with Battelle (568 pages, wow), I'm wondering about two things.
 * [ ] Do you guys come into contact with **DOE Project Management Procedures** very often? I think there's some good to be gained from project management, and would be interested to learn more about their take on it.
 * [ ] I noticed the "fee base" for FY'16 is $892M, and then drops to around $810M for FY'17 thru FY'22. Is that related to operating budget? I've never heard of a fee base before, but if it's related to operating budget, a ~10% reduction sounds painful.

1. [ ] Information and Infrastructure - Digital Ants
 * [ ] I've had an interest in swarm computing for a long time. Inspired my MS thesis.
