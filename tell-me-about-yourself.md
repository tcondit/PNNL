# Tell me about yourself

My least favorite question. Maybe I can make it my favorite question.

## Things I think are worth talking about

* Service oriented: love to help out, love to get people unblocked. But will
  encourage people to try and answer their own questions first, before bringing
  them to me. I've been in, and am in fact just leaving an environment where we
  were a little to quick to solve simpler issues for people, which created an
  unhealthy (IMO) dependency relationship.

* Always learning: currently learning Terraform for server stack creation.
  After I've got a comfortable handle on that, I'll move on to server
  provisioning with Ansible. *[Good time to mention my API-based password
  manager idea?]*

* Not a tooling fetishist: I prefer some things over others (and don't care for
  some popular tools), but will use what works, depending on the situation. I
  love command line tools where appropriate. For example, I don't use Git GUIs,
  but love the visual display of GitHub for doing code reviews and pull
  requests.

* Loyal: I don't have much interest in moving around very often. It's so much
  nicer (IMO) to be established somewhere, and know how to get things done.

* Connector: I love to put people together. The flip side of that is, I don't
  want to be anyone's bottleneck. Sometimes people think it's good to be the
  conduit thru which everything flows, but ...

* Tend toward introversion, but with a strong desire to understand people on a
  deeper than superficial level. I'm super interested in what makes people
  tick. So for example, while I'd love to sit down with each of you and get to
  know you, if I was invited to a party, I'd have to force myself to go.

## Boring work history stuff

* Leading a team of CI/CD and environments engineers

* Tools included 
 * AWS (CloudFormation, EC2, ELB, S3, VPC, routing, security groups, etc.)
 * Jenkins (OCD, Dev, SharedServices)
  * Servers provisioned for OCD and for developers and operations
 * Artifactory (OCD, Dev, SharedServices)
 * Chef
 * Git / GitHub

## Also be sure to mention

* Just got AWS Developer Associate certification

* Going to re:Invent next week

* All servers required to be rehydrated every 60 days (what a pain), which
  forced us to write automation.

* Seattle JAM co-organizer

* CapitalOne Coders school lead and lead instructor
