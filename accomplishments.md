* Distelli
 * Over the course of about 6 months, worked to get the vendor in-house
 * Long process:
  * Socializing the application among developers
  * Doing multiple demos and taking feature requests
  * Working with the vendor (who became friends of mine) to prioritize new features
   * We worked thru a number of issues with them as they hustled like crazy to add on-prem features to their SaaS solution. They're great to work with, really sharp guys.
   * Working with Disney Imagineering (their other large prospect/customer at the time) to ensure we were in sync
  * Socializing the application among senior leadership, up to and including the CTO of Capital One
   * That's where things started to go off the rails
 * DeploymentPipelinePOC
  * Starting with 18 vendors and/or open source projects, narrowed it down to two: XebiaLabs (XLRelease, XLDeploy) and Distelli
   * Distelli won with the developers, operations
    * I sent out surveys, had the team come in to pitch to our release management team, etc.
    * Release management wanted XLRelease. They felt their voices were not heard, so I spent some time explaining why we reached the decision we did. It was my view that we were taking input from the teams, but as owners, we'd be the majority shareholders.
 * Erik and his manager both signed off on it.
 * But like I said, the demo to the CTO (Rob Alexander) was where things started to go downhill.
 * We had a dev/QA environment up in AWS, and were in the middle of standing up the prod environment when we were told to cancel the project and remove the ASV.
 * My manager and I went to their offices to tell them in person. It was a disappointment, but Rahul was a professional. We're still friends. I stop by to see them about once a month.
