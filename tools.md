# Tools I know and love (or something like that)

## Chef

* My view: for server provisioning (configuration management) only!
 * CM is about keeping things from changing, IOW managing configuration drift
 * Using Chef for deployments is exactly the opposite activity. It's a poor fit.

* Worked with the OpsDBAs to get the encrypted data bags into our combined Chef cookbooks + CloudFormation templates for standing up services.

How did we use ... ?

* [ ] roles
* [ ] environments
* [ ] cookbooks


## Jenkins

* v1.x
