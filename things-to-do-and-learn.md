# An unordered list of things to do and learn in the DevOps space

This should be a spreadsheet

## Technology (regardless of brand)

* Containers
* Secrets management
* Container orchestration
* API development and consumption
* Stack provisioning
* Stack configuration management
* Software configuration management
* Continuous Integration
* Continuous Delivery (&& Continuous Deployment)
* Test automation
 * integration and functional (application) testing
 * infrastructure testing

## Technology (product / sponsor or company)

* Rancher / Rancher
* Kubernetes / Google
* Terraform (continue) / HashiCorp
* Ansible (continue) / RedHat
 * as an IT automation tool / task execution engine, can handle stack CM and deployments
* Docker (unavoidable) / Docker
 * also containers WITHOUT using Docker / unaffiliated
* Chef (continue) / Chef
 * I'm on the fence with this one
 * To some degree, can't dictate the market
 * On the other hand, I don't want to address the whole market
* Secret management (KMS, Vault) / AWS, HashiCorp
* TestInfra, ServerSpec, Kitchen
